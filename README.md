# neoterm-am-socket

This is a small program for sending commands to the NeoTerm:API app,
thereby allowing terminal programs to use the Android API. The program
replaces [neotermAm](https://github.com/juic3b0x/neotermAm), and uses a
unix socket to transfer information between the app and userspace,
thereby speeding up api commands by almost a factor 10.
